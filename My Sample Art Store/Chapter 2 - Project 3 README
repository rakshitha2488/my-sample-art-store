Project 3: art Store DifficuLty 
LEvEL: Advanced

Overview

This project is the first step in the creation of an art store website. Unlike the previ- ous exercises, 
your task is to create an HTML page from scratch based on the image in Figure 2.25.

Instructions

1. Define your own chapter02-project03.html file in the editor of your choice, and open it in a browser.

2. Add markup and content, making best guesses as to what HTML markup to use.

3. Remember to try and get in the habit of using semantic markup, since it adds meaning and has no visual impact.

Test

1. Display your page in a browser, and determine if it looks like Figure 2.25.

2. Validate the page by pasting the HTML into http://validator.w3.org/ and
   seeing if it passes.
